### Whole genome sequencing of *Pandoraea apista* 

*Pandoraea apista* is an emerging cystic fibrosis (CF) pathogen that is a 
motile, non-spore-forming, non-fermenting, polymyxin-resistant, Gram-negative 
bacillus.  The genus classification of *Pandoraea* was described in 2000 
following taxonomic revision of isolates that had phenotypically been 
identified as either *Burkholderia* or *Ralstonia* species. Pandoraea species 
have been isolated from a variety of clinical specimens from both CF and non-CF 
patients including respiratory specimens, blood, and urine. Many CF patients 
experience a decline in lung function after chronic colonization with 
*Pandoraea* is established that may be due, in part, to a *Pandoraea*-specific 
pro-inflammatory response.

To date there has been no whole genome sequencing projects for *P. apista*. We 
believe there is a lot to learn from the *P. apista* genome. Using both Oxford 
Nanopore's MinION and Illumina MiSeq, we have set out to produce the first 
sequenced *P. apista* genome.
